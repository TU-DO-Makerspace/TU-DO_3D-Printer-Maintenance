# Welcome to the TU-DO Makerspace 3D Printer Maintance Book

The goal of this documentation is to collect and archive general usage and maintenance information for the 3D printers in the TU-DO Makerspace.

Ideally the documentation should provide the following information for each printer:
 - Printer specifications along clear indications of any modifications compared to the original specifications
 - Ideal/Optimal Slicer settings
 - Which firmware is installed and how to flash it
 - A general guide on how to use the printer
 - Known issues to be aware of
 - A disassembly and reassembly guide
 - A list of common problems and their solutions or workarounds

## Contributing

The documentation is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/TU-DO-Makerspace/TU-DO_3D-Printer-Maintenance) and utilizes [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) to generate the static site. The site is hosted via GitHub Pages. All markdown files are located in the `src` folder, the `docs` folder is generated by MkDocs and should not be edited manually.

It is recommended to get familiar with MkDocs first before contributing to the documentation. The [MkDocs documentation](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/writing-your-docs/) provides a good overview of the syntax used to write the documentation.

Before committing changes to the documentation, please make sure to run `mkdocs build` to generate the static site and check if everything looks as expected. To push your changes to the documentation, you must either have write access to the repository or create a pull request.
